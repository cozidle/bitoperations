# BitOperations!

This project is all about having fun with bitwise operators.

## Motivation:

I am not really interested in bitwise operators, and while learning a programming language
that is something i always ignore. Idk, what project i was doing but for some reason i wanted to know
how to make a function for log base of 2, ofc, if not searched well we only find what is the integer value
of log2(x), but i just tried dig deeper and found a website("https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html"),
and man i was hooked. After this i wanted to make all stuff using C basic bitwise operators.

## Disclaimer:

I might be the writer of this code but except for some ideas, many of them i found after i stucked somewhere and found in internet,
and don't take any credit for such beautifully written code, any code that i didn't think myself, i gave the source of where i found those.
